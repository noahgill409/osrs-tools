	f: current defense level -> accuracy of all weapons (bgs/dwh/scy)
	f: (max hit, accuracy) -> damage distribution
	f: randomly choose how many DWH hit based on defence current
		f: convert n DWH hits into a damage distribution
	f: randomly choose how many BGS hit based on defence current
		f: convert n BGS hits into a damage distribution
	
	
General roadmap
	Create markov chains for all necessary transitions in def reduction and damage (handled separately because of DWH for olm and miss reduction because of tekton)
		DWH damage --(independent of)-- DWH reduction
		BGS damage -(implications on)-> BGS reduction
		Scy damage
		
		
		
	
	Apply one of a few procedures for initiating special attacks on the opponent
		Monte Carlo (MC) for DWH dmg/spec separately needs to randomly choose
			hit or not?
				no: 0/miss reduction
				yes: damage/70%
		MC on BGS damage, apply this via def red Markov Chain to account for overkill
			hit or not?
				no: 0/miss reduction
				yes: damage/damage reduction
		Scythe until absorbed
